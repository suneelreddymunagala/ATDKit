# Introduction #

**LTSupportAutomotive** is a library for writing apps that communicate with vehicles using **OBD2** adapters. It also contains auxilliary classes, such as a *VIN decoder*, and a *BTLE characteristic(s) / `NSStream`* serial bridge.

Here is an overview over the most important classes:

### LTOBD2Adapter (Abstract) ###

Represents an OBD2 adapter sending commands over input- and output-streams using a certain vehicle protocol. Concrete subclasses (e.g. for ELM327-chipsets or capture files) are available.

### LTOBD2Command (Abstract) ###

Represents an OBD2 command. Concrete subclasses, e.g. for the well-known OBD2 PIDs are available.

### LTOBD2Protocol (Abstract) ###

Represents a generic vehicle protocol. Concrete subclasses for protocols such as ISO14230-4 (CAN), ISO15765-4, ISO9141-2, or SAEJ1850 are available.

### LTBTLESerialTransporter ###

Represents a bridge between one or two BTLE characteristics and NSStream subclasses.

# How to use LTSupportAutomotive #

### CococaPods ###

Add this framework to your podfile:
```
pod 'LTSupportAutomotive', '~> 1.0'
```

### Carthage ###

If anyone wants to make this *carthage* aware, feel free to supply a pull request. I'm not using this package manager myself.

### As Xcode subproject ###

You can also include LTSupportAutomotive as an Xcode subproject and link `LTSupportAutomotive.framework` to your executable.

# Examples #

`LTAutomotiveSupportDemo.xcodeproj` is a (pretty bare-bones) example project.

# Apps using this library #

* [OBD2 Expert](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/obd2-expert/id1142156521?mt=8) (yours truly)
* [Cargo Objects Street Assistant](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/cargo-objects-street-assistant/id1092020114?mt=8) (LAWA-Solutions GmbH)

Please drop us a note, if you are using this library as well.

# Supported Hardware #

This software should work with most ELM327-compatible hardware (including the behemoth of available *clones*).

I have tested this library myself with the following adapters:

### BTLE (aka BLE or BluetoothSmart) ###
* Carista Bluetooth OBD2
* LELink Bluetooth Low Energy

### WiFi ###
* NAVISKAUTO WIFI WLAN ELM327

# TODO #

While this library can already be used for a lot of things, I'd like to see improvements in a bunch of areas, such as:

* Translations (I only have DE and EN atm.),
* Implementation of some of the missing standardized PIDs,
* Addition of vendor-specific DTCs,
* Implementation of vendor-specific PIDs,
* Implementation of non-PID/direct communication with ECUs using lower-level CAN protocols.
* Being able to use J2534 PassThrough adapters (these are also available for trucks w/ 24V bord systems)

# How to contribute #

Please fork and open a pull-request. I'd also like to know about success stories or confirmation for additional compatible hardware (see above) working with this library.
